freqRIR
=======

|Documentation Status| |Python package|

Generate a room impuse response in the frequency domain.

Documentation
-------------

Read the documentation
`Docs <https://freqrir.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`__

Time domain
-----------

Plot a typical impulse repsonse for a room 80 x 12 x 100 sample lengths
long. Wall reflection coefficients were all 0.9, ceiling and floor
coefficients were 0.7. Source and receiver were at (30, 100, 40) amd
(50, 10, 60) sample periods [1].
