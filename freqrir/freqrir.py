def frequency_rir(receiver, source, room_dimensions, betas, points, frequency, c=304.8, T=1E-4):
    """ 
    Calculate room impulse response in the frequency domain. 

    Args:
        receiver (list[float] with shape (3,)) : Reciever location in sample periods (s).
        source (list[float] with shape(3,)) : Source location in sample periods (s).
        room_dimensions (list[float] with shape (3,)) : Room dimensions in sample periods (s).
        betas (float np-array with shape (3,2)) : Absorbtion coefficients. Walls: left, right, front, back, floor, ceiling.
        points (int) :  Number of points, which determines precisions of bins. 

        c (float, optional) : Speed of sound (m/s). Defaults to 304.8 m/s (i.e. 1 ft/ms) (Allen 1979).
        T (float, optional) : Sampling period (s). Defaults to 1E-4 s (i.e. 0.1 ms) (Allen 1979).

    Returns:
        pressure (complex) : A pressure wave in the frequency domain.

    Raises:
        ValueError : If source and receiver are too close together (i.e. within 0.5 sampling periods).
